New Design:
 - columnWidths is an array in the state of a parent component...???
 - ColumnHeading is a component with name, width, orderedState, expanded, children?
 - Query only holds an equivalent of SQL query, plus expanded columns.
 - Data is held in a Table. CollectionTable. ODataTable. 
 - 

Introduce an immutability library.

Expand columns (not working for the 'interesting' demo).
    - Expanded columns must also be movable.
    - Currently working in collectionQuery.ts.
